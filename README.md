# html-form-to-google-sheets-php
This PHP project collects user input from an HTML form and stores the data directly into Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API. It uses a secure service account for authentication and saves each form submission as a new row. This project is useful for contact forms, surveys, and small applications without a database.
